"Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections... but it doesn't. Rapid "
"and timely updates ensure that there are very few, if any threats to Linux "
"systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality, there have "
"been very few \"public\" infections in the last 10 years that can affect "
"Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone installing or using a "
"modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it "
"difficult for viruses, root kits and other malware to be installed and run "
"without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally"
" invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and "
"won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu MATE."

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu MATE opens"
" a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu MATE will recognize the file as a program. The system"
" provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a "
"program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra "
"secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."
msgstr "例如，其他作業系統由檔名來決定使用哪個程式來開啟它，然後馬上就試圖開啟。這種設計使電腦容易被入侵者攻擊。Ubuntu MATE則是由檔案的權限決定，而非檔名。所以即使惡意程式嘗試以\"Last Will and Testament.txt\"這種檔名來偽裝自己，Ubuntu MATE也可以辨別出它是一個程式而非單純的文件。系統會提出警告它並非純文字文件並阻止他繼續，除非您給了它權限。如需額外的安全性，Ubuntu MATE還可以在每一次您授予權限前要求提供管理員密碼，沒有密碼就無法取得權限。"
