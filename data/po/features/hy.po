"Ubuntu MATE is a modern computer operating system, with an attractive and "
"easy to understand user interface. Its update manager keeps not only the "
"operating system itself, but all of its installed applications updated to "
"the current release. The operating system is more secure, and better "
"supported than operating systems that come pre-installed on most home "
"computer hardware today."

"Ubuntu MATE is designed with security in mind. Unlike operating systems that"
" update only once a month, Ubuntu MATE receives updates continuously. The "
"updates include security patches for Ubuntu MATE and all of its components. "
"Security updates for all of its installed applications are also provided on "
"the same schedule. This ensures that you have the latest protection for all "
"of your computer's software -- as soon as it's available!"

"Ubuntu MATE can get viruses and other infections... but it doesn't. Rapid "
"and timely updates ensure that there are very few, if any threats to Linux "
"systems like Ubuntu MATE that persist in the wild. In reality, there have "
"been very few \"public\" infections in the last 10 years that can affect "
"Ubuntu MATE. They are no longer a threat to anyone installing or using a "
"modern Linux distribution today. Ubuntu MATE is designed to make it "
"difficult for viruses, root kits and other malware to be installed and run "
"without conscious intervention by you, the user. Even if you do accidentally"
" invite in an infection, chances are it's designed to attack Windows and "
"won't do much, if any damage to Ubuntu MATE."

"Another significant security feature of Ubuntu MATE is that its users are "
"not administrators by default. Administrators (\"root\" users) on any "
"computer system have permission to do anything they want, including the "
"ability to damage the system."

"For example, other operating systems look at the name of a file to determine"
" which program should open it, then immediately attempt to open it. That "
"design makes it easy for an intruder to attack a computer. Ubuntu MATE opens"
" a file based on what the file is, not based on its name. So even if a "
"malicious program disguises its identity by using the name \"Last Will and "
"Testament.txt\" Ubuntu MATE will recognize the file as a program. The system"
" provides a warning that the file is not a text file, but that it is a "
"program that will be run if you give it permission to continue. To be extra "
"secure, Ubuntu MATE requires you to provide your administrator password "
"before that permission is granted. Every single time."
