Test scripts are to be written in Python and placed in `tests/`


=== Import ===

Start with:

    import common.testing as test


=== Functions ===

test.start()          Prints the start of the test log.
test.error(str)       Prints an error reason and indicates a test failure.
test.warning(str)     Prints a warning, but isn't serious enough to fail the test.
test.end()            Prints the end of the test log.

determine if a commit or pull request is suitable for merging.

test.failed           Boolean indicating success or failure.
test.repo_root        String containing the top-level folder where the repository is located.
